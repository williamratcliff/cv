Research Interests
------------------

The primary focus of my research has been multiferroic materials.  Recently, I have explored geometric ferroelectricity in the |LuFeO3| series of compounds in both bulk and thin film samples (see 18,20, and 21) culminating 
in work with collaborators in the development of superlattices with near room temperature magneto-electric  effects.  Our neutron scattering work was key in understanding the intrinsic 
magnetic ordering of the |LuFeO3| geometric ferroelectric which templates |LuFe2O4| in the |LuFeO3|-|LuFe2O4| superlattice to dramatic effect.  Currently, I am working on topological materials (see 2,3,4,5,16).  Of particular interest is the interplay of magnetism with topological materials. 
For example in the |MnBi2Te4| system, our measurements of the magnetic structure under applied magnetic fields has direct implications for the band structure.  I am also interested in the use of AI to accelerate neutron scattering measurements and analysis.
