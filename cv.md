## Research Interests

The primary focus of my research has been multiferroic materials. Recently, I have explored geometric ferroelectricity in the LuFeO<sub>3</sub> series of compounds in both bulk and thin film samples, culminating in work with collaborators in the development of superlattices with near room temperature magneto-electric effects. Our neutron scattering work was key in understanding the intrinsic magnetic ordering of the LuFeO<sub>3</sub> geometric ferroelectric which templates LuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in the LuFeO<sub>3</sub>-LuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> superlattice to dramatic effect.

Currently, I am working on topological materials. Of particular interest is the interplay of magnetism with topological materials. For example in the MnBi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>4</sub> system, our measurements of the magnetic structure under applied magnetic fields has direct implications for the band structure. I am also interested in the use of AI to accelerate neutron scattering measurements and analysis.
