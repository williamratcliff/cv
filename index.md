<img src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="William Ratcliff" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; width: 200px; border-radius: 10px;">

I am a **Physicist** at the [NIST Center for Neutron Research](https://www.nist.gov/ncnr) and an **Adjunct Associate Professor** at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu) in both the [Physics](https://umdphysics.umd.edu) and [Materials Science & Engineering](https://mse.umd.edu) departments.

I am a **Fellow of the American Physical Society** and currently serve as **Chair of the APS Topical Group on Magnetism**.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on:
- **Multiferroic materials** - materials exhibiting both magnetic and ferroelectric order
- **Topological materials** - particularly the interplay of magnetism with topological band structures
- **AI/Machine Learning** - accelerating neutron scattering measurements and analysis
