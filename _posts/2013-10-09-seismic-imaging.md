I recently acquired two technical books on seismic imaging:

- "Seismic Imaging and Inversion: Application of Linear Inverse Theory" by Stolt and Weglein
- "Digital Imaging and Deconvolution: The ABCs of Seismic Exploration and Processing" by Robinson and Treitel

Due to a government shutdown (day 9), I had unexpected time to read, as working during the shutdown was prohibited. I began with the ABC textbook, which cautions readers seeking practical applications to consult alternative references like works by Yilmaz or Liner.

The first chapter covers foundational concepts including wave theory and geometric optics. The material is engaging—more discussion to follow in subsequent posts.

The wave equation:

$$\nabla^2 u = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}$$
