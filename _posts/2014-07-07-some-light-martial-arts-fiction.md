I recently read the CUHK Series novel "Fox Valant of the Snowy Mountain" by Jin Yang.

## Language & Style

The translator used archaic or formal English, requiring dictionary lookups on the Kindle. I grew to appreciate this distinctive tone.

## Narrative Structure

The book employs a multi-perspective storytelling technique similar to recent films. Characters introduced early as antagonists are revealed to be heroic when viewed through other characters' perspectives—a psychologically interesting approach that creates initial bias.

## Central Theme

The story explores pride's dual nature—sometimes motivating, sometimes destructive. I found myself reflecting on personal experiences with pride. Have you ever had the feeling of meeting the sky above the sky?

## Skill Development Question

A character gains martial prowess from reading a scroll fragment. I question this plausibility—while instructional books and videos help, they cannot fully capture the feelings behind a number of techniques without a teacher's guidance.

## Conclusion

It was a good read, though I regretted the open ending.
