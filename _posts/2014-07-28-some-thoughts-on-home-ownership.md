Is buying or renting a $300,000 townhouse in Maryland financially comparable? Let me break down the numbers.

## Monthly Ownership Costs

- Maintenance: $4,000/year (1.5% of home value)
- Property taxes: $3,300/year
- Insurance and utilities: $1,150/year
- Mortgage: $14,580/year (with 20% down at 4.5%)

This comes to approximately $1,920/month before tax deductions.

After accounting for tax deductions on interest and property taxes, the monthly cost reduces to roughly $1,580. When factoring in closing costs and selling expenses over a 7-year holding period, the total monthly cost reaches approximately $2,000—comparable to rental prices in the same area.

## Challenging Common Assumptions

Home appreciation shouldn't exceed inflation long-term, and equity accumulation must account for opportunity costs of the initial down payment. Risks of ownership include:

- Foreclosure liability in recourse states
- Market downturns
- Rising property taxes as municipalities address budget pressures

## Conclusion

The question of owning vs renting depends on your assumptions regarding investment returns, inflation, and personal risk tolerance rather than being an obvious financial advantage.
