I recently learned a new word: **ultracrepidarianism** - "the giving of opinions and advice on matters outside of one's knowledge."

This connects to research by Dunning and Kruger, which explains how people often become overconfident once they begin learning something new. This is a particularly risky tendency in cross-disciplinary work.

This serves as a personal reminder to approach unfamiliar topics with appropriate caution. As Alexander Pope wrote in 1711:

> "A little learning is a dang'rous thing;
> Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring"

The passage emphasizes that shallow knowledge can be misleading, while deeper study brings wisdom and humility.
