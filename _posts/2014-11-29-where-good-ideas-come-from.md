I recently read Steven Johnson's book *Where Good Ideas Come From*. While some biological analogies in the work are overstated, Johnson's key recommendations for fostering creativity are worth noting:

- Take walks
- Prioritize sleep (with a note that sleep segmentation might be beneficial)
- Embrace mistakes
- Pursue hobbies
- Engage with unfamiliar people
- Synthesize different concepts
- Maintain detailed notes
- Establish yourself in or near urban environments

The book provides a useful framework for understanding how innovative thinking develops through environmental and behavioral factors.
