I recently read Jim Manzi's book *Uncontrolled*, which examines the philosophy of science and the role of randomized experimentation across different fields.

## Scientific Advantage in Physics

Physics benefits from fundamental models tested against observations. The discipline rests on assumptions like "the laws of physics don't change from place to place" and remain constant over time.

## Challenges in Other Fields

Medicine, sociology, and economics lack physics's robust foundational models. These fields require randomized trials to distinguish genuine effects from coincidental ones. Even successful trials can be difficult to generalize across different populations or contexts.

## Business Applications

The book's strongest section covers Manzi's use of randomized experiments in business strategy, drawing on literature from medical trials and social science research, including welfare reform experiments from the 1990s.

## Political Relevance

This connects to books on political campaign testing, such as *Get Out the Vote*, which examine experimental evidence for effective voter mobilization strategies.

## Overall Assessment

While the policy recommendations section is weaker, I'd recommend the book for fostering healthy skepticism toward predictions lacking experimental validation.
