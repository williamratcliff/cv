I recently read Jo Boaler's *What's Math Got to Do with It?*, which explores the disconnect between how mathematics is taught in American schools versus how mathematicians actually practice the discipline.

## The Problem

Several issues plague traditional math education:
- Students develop apathy and fear toward mathematics
- Teaching emphasizes isolated problem-solving rather than real-world application
- There's a gap between classroom methods and how professionals use math

## Proposed Solutions

Boaler recommends multiple approaches:
- Students communicating solutions through various representations (graphs, tables, words)
- Project-based learning lasting several weeks
- Collaborative group work rather than silent individual problem-solving

## Assessment Concerns

Standardized testing emphasizes "procedure under timed conditions rather than actual problem solving ability." Boaler proposes "Assessment for learning" with clear feedback beyond simple scores.

## Additional Issues

The book also addresses tracking systems, gender disparities in math confidence, and the importance of developing abstract thinking skills.

## Overall Assessment

This is a good book. Effective instruction must engage students and facilitate peer communication rather than relying on passive lecture approaches.
