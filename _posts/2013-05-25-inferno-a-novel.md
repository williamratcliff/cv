I recently read Dan Brown's novel *Inferno*, which centers on Malthusian theory about population growth outpacing resource availability.

## The Malthusian Problem

The novel's plot involves a character who accepts Malthus's premise that "geometric population growth" would eventually exceed linear resource growth, leading to catastrophe.

## Why Malthus Was Wrong (So Far)

Humanity has avoided the predicted collapse through scientific advancement, particularly the Green Revolution. However, this progress relied on fossil fuels—a finite resource.

## Population Stabilization

There's evidence suggesting developed societies produce fewer children, with global population expected to stabilize around 2050, potentially providing centuries to develop solutions.

## Alternative Concerns

I'd argue overpopulation is less pressing than climate change and energy security. I also question the romanticized notion that pandemics (like the Black Plague) benefit humanity overall.

## Personal Note

I studied engineering physics in college and have limited formal humanities education, making my engagement with Dan Brown's interdisciplinary thriller particularly interesting.
